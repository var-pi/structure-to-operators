# structure-to-operators

This repository collects concise, structure-first notes connecting
**physical, geometric, and analytic structure** to the design,
analysis, discretization, and learning of **operators**.

The unifying principle is that many problems in physics, PDEs, and
scientific machine learning are best understood not at the level of
solutions, but at the level of the **operators** generating them.
Geometric, variational, and analytic structure strongly constrains the
admissible class of such operators, and exploiting this structure is
key to robustness, efficiency, and generalization.
